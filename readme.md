This discord bot can block (bad) words for each guild it is in. There is an seperate array for every guild in guilds.json file. For more detailed information, check the code or open an issue here.

Feel free to use the code for whatever you want, but it would be a nice turn if you leave credits for me.


Some information:
The token in an old version of settings.json is actually useless, no need to try any useless shit ;)
